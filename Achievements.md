1) What has gone well in the past quarter?
```
Over the past quarter, I played a pivotal role in driving a cloud transformation initiative from the ground up. I successfully led the containerization of two Java microservices on AWS ECS within a dedicated 3–4-month timeframe. This included end-to-end ownership—from setting up GitHub repositories and structuring the codebase using GRD templates, to creating Dockerfiles and provisioning ECS clusters via nested CloudFormation templates. I also designed and implemented ALB configurations, handled dependency management through JFrog, and ensured full integration of OSA framework in Docker. Additionally, I onboarded applications to Kibana and Grafana for observability and performed successful validations with Kafka, MQ, JMS, and databases. On the data front, I helped lead the setup and execution of database migrations using AWS DMS, covering both Oracle and PostgreSQL engines. I also supported a recent initiative involving OCI by extracting DDL/DML statements and connecting the application to the OCI DB using TCP. These milestones highlight the effectiveness of planning, execution, and collaboration with cross-functional teams.

3) What could have been done better?
```
While the outcomes have been very positive, there's always room for growth. One key area of ongoing focus is proactively identifying future scaling and optimization opportunities for containerized services and cloud infrastructure. I also aim to further streamline legacy artifact integration processes to accelerate migration timelines even further. That said, the progress this quarter has laid a solid foundation for continuous improvement.

4) What actions have you taken to develop skills identified against your goals?
```
I have been deeply involved in hands-on work that aligns closely with my upskilling goals—particularly around cloud architecture, DevOps, and database migration. By independently authoring and deploying CloudFormation templates, working with Docker, ECS, and load balancers, and integrating monitoring tools like Kibana and Grafana, I’ve significantly deepened my expertise in AWS cloud services and microservices architecture. Additionally, working with both Oracle and PostgreSQL engines, and setting up DMS pipelines, has expanded my practical experience in cloud-native data migration strategies. I continue to explore advanced AWS concepts, container security best practices, and infrastructure as code methodologies to grow further in this space.

5) What kind of support do you need from company/team/manager to achieve the desired skill levels?
```
To continue growing and delivering impact, I would appreciate opportunities to:
•	Contribute to more architectural discussions and planning sessions.
•	Gain access to strategic project roadmaps.
•	Receive mentorship or peer reviews for complex IAC or migration strategies to refine best practices.
Such support would further enhance my ability to deliver scalable, secure, and resilient solutions in alignment with company goals.
